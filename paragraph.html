<!--Hi htsdsdml is very cool to learn-->
<p>
What is the difference between Git stash apply and Git stash pop?
Ans.The 'Git stash apply' and 'Git stash pop'commands are used when you have to reapply the stashed changes and start working from where you left.
<p>
The difference between them is that while the 'Git stash apply' command keeps the changes in the stash list for later use,the 'Git stash pop' command removes the changes from the stash after
applying it.
